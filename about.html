<section id="about">
    <h1>What is this?</h1>

    <p>
        This application is a tool to help us &mdash; the community &mdash; record, improve and select
        the actual presentations for <a href="http://euruko2013.org/">EuRuKo 2013</a>.
        The code is based on <a href="http://rubymanor.org/">Ruby Manor's</a> original
        <a href="http://vestibule.rubymanor.org/proposals">vestibule app</a>, and we are really thankful for that!
        With this tool we will be able to have our conference the way we want it - at least as far as the presentations go :-)
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>EuRuKo 2013 would be a lesser conference without your presentations</strong>.
        We think that almost everyone has something interesting to say,
        so please think about that fun or unusual or difficult or surprising thing
        you&rsquo;ve done recently and submit a talk (or several!) so that everyone can hear about it.
    </p>

    <p>
        We welcome all kinds of engaging Ruby related presentations,
        however we will be even happier if you propose an original presentation which
        will not appear in any other conference prior to EuRuKo 2013.
        Ruby was first coded in 1993 and so this summer we'd like to celebrate its 20th birthday
        by having the plethora of presentations focused mostly on the language,
        its evolution, its future and its internals wherever possible.
    </p>

    <h1>The EuRuKo 2013 CfP process</h1>

    <section id="rationale">
        <h2>Rationale</h2>
        <p>
            The CfP was designed with the following goals in mind:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Encourage proposal submissions by everyone (irrespective of publicity, gender, race, domain etc).</li>
            <li>Encourage refinements on proposals.</li>
            <li>Make sure that the selection process is neutral and unbiased.</li>
            <li>Make sure that the most interesting proposals are actually selected by the community.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="process-overview">
        <h2>The process overview</h2>
        <p>
            The process is an amalgamation of
            <a href="http://vestibule.rubymanor.org/the-vestibule-process" target="_blank">Ruby Manor's ‘Vestibule’ process</a>,
            <a href="https://github.com/euruko2012/call-for-proposals" target="_blank">last year’s EuRuKo</a>
            and our own ideas and favourite picks from various conferences we have attended ourselves in the past.

            The main ideas are rather simple:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Make it safe and easy for everyone to submit their proposal.</li>
            <li>Gather, discuss and refine a lot of ideas in an anonymous (blind) way without prejudice.</li>
            <li>Make a shortlist of the best proposals using some “interestingness” criteria.</li>
            <li>Publicly vote for the presentations that you want to see.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Phase 1: Submission and discussion</h3>
        <p>
            During Phase 1 the CfP platform will be open to submissions by everyone.
            Authors may submit an unlimited number of proposals.
            During this period everyone will be able to interact with the submitted proposals.
            This means that anyone can:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Discuss</li>
            <li>Promote/Demote</li>
            <li>Share on social media</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Authors may therefore:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Refine their proposals</li>
            <li>Withdraw their proposals</li>
            <li>Add more proposals</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <strong>During this phase, all proposals will appear anonymised to the public.</strong>
            Author names as well as any other information that may give away the identity of the author
            will be redacted at this phase. The rationale is that at this point the audience should be focusing
            on the content rather than the author.
        </p>
        <p>
            With this 'blind' submission, we want to encourage <strong>everyone</strong> to participate
            in EuRuKo 2013 and have the chance to have their proposal discussed online
            without prejudice.
        </p>

        <h3>Interlude: Submissions freeze &amp; final call for shortlist selection</h3>
        <p>
            Following the end of Phase 1 <em>(see below for exact dates)</em>, the platform will close for further submissions.
            Consequently the audience may interact with the proposals only for the purpose of making a final shortlist.
            This shortlist will be the one used for the final voting. "Interacting" during this phase means:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Promote/Demote</li>
            <li>Share on social media</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Authors at this stage may only:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Withdraw</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Phase 2: Final voting &amp; selection</h3>
        <p>
            During phase 2 the audience will be called to vote on the proposals that have at this point
            made it into the shortlist. At this phase <strong>all proposals will be named and the authors
            will be identified, including the ones that didn't make it to the shortlist</strong>.

    <h1>FAQ</h1>

    <section id="faq-submissions">
        <h2>Submissions</h2>

        <h3>Why should I give a talk?</h3>

        <p>
  It&rsquo;s a good opportunity to be heard by a large number of delegates,
  including some of Ruby's top developers and decision makers,
  and we&rsquo;ll put together a high-quality video of your talk that you can share
  with everyone who couldn&rsquo;t get there on the day.

  Additionally, all who make it into the shortlist <strong>will get a free ticket for EuRuKo 2013!</strong>
</p>


        <h3>Who will I be talking to?</h3>

        <p>Your audience will consist of people who are interested in coming to EuRuKo 2013: this mostly means Ruby programmers from around Europe, but there will also be many people who come from much further away.  There may be people who don&rsquo;t use Ruby, or aren&rsquo;t programmers, or both.  Primarily however, it&rsquo;s a Ruby-focussed and deeply-technical crowd.</p>


        <h3>What can I talk about?</h3>

        <p>Euruko 2013 celebrates Ruby’s 20 years and the newest 2.0 version. We ask you to submit original talks about the beauty and elegance this jewel of a language brings in our daily programming lives. Come and talk about Ruby’s unique features, best practices and your experiences with the language in all aspects of programming.  That being said, we're open to original mind-blowing proposals but the committee keeps the right to disqualify off-topic or irrelevant ones.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://euruko2013.org/#contributors">EuRuKo 2013 team</a> will be actively leaving suggestions on each talk proposal to help get the ball rolling.  However, if you&rsquo;re not quite sure your idea is ready for public feedback yet, or just want some reassurance that you&rsquo;re on the right track, <a href="mailto:info@euruko2013.org?subject=Can+I+get+some+help+coming+up+with+my+proposal%3F">please do get in touch with us</a> and we&rsquo;ll give you some pointers.</p>

        <p>
            You should take a look at <a href="motivation.html">list of things people are hoping to get out of EuRuKo 2013</a>
            for some inspiration.
        </p>

        <h3>How long should my talk be?</h3>

        <p>Talks should be around 30 minutes + 15 minutes for Q&A.</p>


        <h3>How anonymous does my proposal have to be?</h3>

        <p>
            Although the proposal system is completely anonymous during Phase 1 of the process,
            we can&rsquo;t prevent you from including identifying information either within the proposal itself
            or on the wider internet. Sometimes this is inevitable: if you want to give a talk about this
            great programming language called Ruby that you developed in 1993, it&rsquo;s not going to take
            too much detective work to reveal your identity.

            That&rsquo;s fine, and there&rsquo;s no need to go to ridiculous lengths to conceal your identity
            if it makes the proposal more difficult to write, but just respect the spirit of the process:
            as far as it is sensible and practical, we would like for talks to be chosen because of what
            they&rsquo;re about, not because of who's presenting.
        </p>

        <h3>Do I have to go through with it if I propose something?</h3>

        <p>
            Of course not! No one is going to force you to give a talk just because you proposed it!
            You always have the option to withdraw your proposal if you change your mind or discover you
            can&rsquo;t make it to the conference.
        </p>

        <p>
            That being said, after the final selection is completed (Phase 2), we <strong>will</strong>
            require commitment from your side after having confirmed with you that you are indeed interested
            in attending and presenting at EuRuKo 2013.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section id="faq-suggestions">
        <h2>Suggestions</h2>

        <h3>Why should I participate?</h3>

        <p>
            As mentioned before the goals of the process are, among others, to choose the best
            proposals and also to help them improve. This way, we can enjoy the most interesting
            talks during EuRuKo 2013. To convince you to get engaged, <strong>we have reserved
            a certain amount of tickets for EuRuKo 2013 for those who have contributed
            positively in the proposals suggestion and selection process.</strong>
        </p>

        <h3>What sort of suggestions should I make about a proposal?</h3>

        <p>
            Read the proposal in detail and provide feedback about how you think
            it could be clarified or improved. Ask questions about what it will involve.
            Be constructive and explain what needs to happen in order for the proposal
            to become something you&rsquo;re willing to vote for.
        </p>

        <p>
            Try to avoid simple &ldquo;+1&rdquo; or &ldquo;Yes, sounds good.&rdquo; style suggestions.

            Say <em>why</em> you&rsquo;re &ldquo;+1&rdquo;-ing the proposal -
            there&rsquo;s got to be a reason and it&rsquo;s possible that you&rsquo;ve assumed
            they&rsquo;ll cover something that they weren&rsquo;t planning to.
        </p>

        <h3>What do I do with suggestions on my proposals?</h3>

        <p>
            There are many ways to deal with suggestions.
            You <em>can</em> simply ignore them - but we think you&rsquo;ll write a better talk
            and get more out of the process if you actively engage with them.

            You can respond with your own comments (which will remain anonymous),
            you can tweak your proposal to accommodate them, or to explicitly rule them out.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section id="faq-selection">
        <h2>Selection</h2>

        <h3>How is the "shortlist" decided?</h3>

        <p>
            The shortlist will be decided based on “interestingness” factors some of which may be:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Number of votes</li>
            <li>Number of views</li>
            <li>Number of comments</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            We will also monitor for:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Mentions on social networks</li>
            <li>Number of refinements</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>How many proposals will make it into the shortlist?</h3>

        <p>There will be 30 slots for the shortlist.</p>

        <h3>How will proposals be chosen from the shortlist?</h3>
        <p>
            During Phase 2 the audience will be called to vote among the entries which made it into the shortlist.
            Once the votes are in, the proposals with the most votes will be selected
            and we will inform the authors in order to confirm their availability.
        </p>

        <h3>How many proposals will be selected?</h3>

        <p>
            10 proposals will be selected from the community (a.k.a. by voting)
            and 1 strictly by the <a href="http://euruko2013.org/#contributors">committee</a>.
        </p>

        <h3>What happens if my proposal makes it to EuRuKo 2013?</h3>

        <p>
            We&rsquo;ll be in touch to confirm that you really are happy to present.
