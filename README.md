Vestibule
=========

This is the simple application that we're using to build the CFP platfrom for [Euruko 2013][]. It's simple purpose is to collect talk proposals, and try to channel feedback and suggestions on those proposals into *useful forms*.

This app is build on top of [Ruby Manor 3][] [original Vestibule app][] and we thank them for that!

Getting started
-----------------

1. Setup a Postgres server. The simplest thing to do is to download the [Turnkey Postgres Appliance][] in the OVF format and run it with [VirtualBox][].
2. Copy config/database.example.yml to config/database.yml and update it appropriately
2. Copy config/application.example.yml to config/application.yml and customize it to fit your needs
3. Set the following environment variable: `COOKIE_SECRET` with a lengthy key
4. Run the tests: `rake`
5. Register the app for the "social login" thing. See section below for more info.
7. Start a server: `rails server`

You should be ready :)

Social login setup
-----------------

Github:

1. Go to settings/applications and add a new application
2. Set URL to whatever makes sense (for example `http://localhost:3000` if it's for your dev environment)
3. Set Callback URL to `<base_url>/auth/github/callback` (so for this example it would be `http://localhost:3000/auth/github/callback`)
4. Set the `GITHUB_KEY` and the `GITHUB_SECRET` to the `Client ID` and the `Client Secret` respectively
5. (Optional) Set these for heroku (after having completed the heroku setup) by running `heroku config:add GITHUB_KEY=<the Client ID>` and `heroku config:add GITHUB_SECRET=<the Client Secret>`

Twitter:

1. Go to ["create a new application"](https://dev.twitter.com/apps/new)
2. Set the Website to whatever makes sense (as with Github)
3. Set Callback URL to `<base_url>/auth/twitter/callback` (so for this example it would be `http://localhost:3000/auth/twitter/callback`)
4. Set the `TWITTER_KEY` and the `TWITTER_SECRET` to the `Consumer key` and the `Consumer secret` respectively
5. (Optional) Set these for heroku (after having completed the heroku setup) by running `heroku config:add TWITTER_KEY=<the Consumer key>` and `heroku config:add TWITTER_SECRET=<the Consumer secret>`

Google:

Nothing to do, it should just work :)

Facebook:

1. Go to create a new application
2. Set the Website with Facebook Login -> `Site URL` to `<base_url>/auth/facebook/callback` (so for this example it would be `http://localhost:3000/auth/facebook/callback`)
4. Set the `FACEBOOK_KEY` and the `FACEBOOK_SECRET` to the `App ID` and the `App Secret` respectively
5. (Optional) Set these for heroku (after having completed the heroku setup) by running `heroku config:add FACEBOOK_KEY=<the App ID>` and `heroku config:add FACEBOOK_SECRET=<the App Secret>`


Deploying on Heroku (non official site)
-----------------

1. Sign up on [Heroku][]
2. Download the [Heroku toolbelt][]
3. Login from the command line: `heroku login`
4. Create your heroku app: `heroku create`
5. Add the New Relic add on (requires credit card information): `heroku addons:add newrelic:standard`
6. Switch to your own branch (or in EuRuKo 2013 case, the `euruko2013` branch) and un-ignore the `config/application.yml` since heroku needs this
7. Deploy: `rake release`
8. Check the app: `heroku open`

For more info, checkout the [official heroku guide][]

Sending emails
-----------------

There are two ways to send emails out of the box: Gmail and Mandrill. The first is pretty much ubiquitous, the latter is the easiest to setup on Heroku.
In any case you have to set first the following environment variables:

* `DEFAULT_MAILER_HOST` which will be used as the `:host` option for the `action_mailer.default_url_options`
* `SMTP_DOMAIN` which will be used as the `:domain` option for the `action_mailer.smtp_settings`

**Setup Gmail**

Set up the additional two environment variables:

* `GMAIL_SMTP_USER`
* `GMAIL_SMTP_PASSWORD`

**Setup Mandrill**

Just add the [Mandrill Heroku Addon](https://addons.heroku.com/mandrill) and you should be ready to go.

Keep in mind that this will work only on production environment.

Exceptions & Errors tracking
-----------------

Sign up for a free account [bugsnag account](http://bugsnag.com) and set the appropriate env variable: `heroku config:add BUGSNAG_API_KEY=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX`
