      <title>Suggestion from Paul Battley (@threedaymonk)</title>
      <description type="html">
        <![CDATA[<p>This talk seems a lot more specific than Matz&#39;s keynote is likely to be (based on his previous keynotes that I&#39;ve seen), so I don&#39;t think there&#39;s necessarily a conflict.</p>

<p>Running mruby on an Arduino sounds impressive. I assume this is one of the newer Arm-based Arduinos, not the old AVR boards, right?</p>

      <description type="html">
        <![CDATA[<p>The talk will be given by a mruby committer. Matz will mention mruby in his Keynote but won&#39;t go into technical details about the usage and implementation. This talk is for people who maybe want to use mruby and need to know the current status quo.</p>

<p>But of course you are right, it is hard to compete against Matz :-) Maybe I can convince him to support this talk. Lets see.</p>

      <title>Suggestion from Clemens Kofler (@clemens)</title>
      <description type="html">
        <![CDATA[<p>I&#39;m curious, so I guess I&#39;d like to see this talk.</p>

<p>However (maybe the organizers can answer this): What if Matz will talk about mruby in his keynote as he did in the past? It&#39;s his current pet project after all. And if I have the choice between Matz – the creator of Ruby and mruby – and someone else talking about mruby, I guess I&#39;d rather go with Matz. ;-)</p>
