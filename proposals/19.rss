      <title>Suggestion from the proposer</title>
      <description type="html">
        <![CDATA[<p>I know it may sound like normal/common stuff like Clemens said, and maybe it is, but I&#39;m going came with a plan to make your apps faster, optimizing your front-end not just CSS and JS, I&#39;m talking about cleaner views, cache, the turbolinks approach on rails 4, and if the time on my side maybe more. </p>

<p>This may not be the specific ruby talk, but you know I think every purist rubist needs to be aware and take care of the their front end apps.</p>

<p>A lot of us are already doing it, but I&#39;m sure that there are  many people out there ignoring this matter</p>

        <![CDATA[<p>What aspects of your talk are Ruby-specific? What can we (roughly) expect that isn&#39;t already covered by tools like YSlow, PageSpeed etc. and their accompanying documentation, blog posts etc.?</p>
