      <description type="html">
        <![CDATA[<p>Xavier, Thanks for your suggestion. I was thinking of mentioning the Lua scripting possibilities when talking about the interesting problems you get into when distributing your application, but I am going to make it explicit now. Anyway, being a 30 minutes session I&#39;m not confident I can really go into much details, but it&#39;s definitely one of the highlights in the latests versions of Redis, so I will show at least a quick mention with a practical application.</p>

      <title>Suggestion from Xavier Noria (@fxn)</title>
      <description type="html">
        <![CDATA[<p>Are you going to cover the fact that you can script with Lua? I have found that&#39;s really interesting and solves many race conditions/transactions headaches, leaning towards and originally named &quot;skinny Ruby, fat Lua&quot; pattern.</p>

        <![CDATA[<p>If you dislike the proposal, I would appreciate a comment saying what you found uninteresting, so I can explain why this is relevant... or maybe I&#39;m just totally wrong and it doesn&#39;t make sense at all, it wouldn&#39;t be the first time it happens :)</p>

<p>Thanks for your feedback!</p>
