        <![CDATA[<p>@Nicolas you have some good points but not the whole audience will be composed from beginners. </p>

<p>I&#39;m totally interested in this topic, but indeed, providing some concrete examples with the direct benefits of immutability would be more than useful. </p>

      <title>Suggestion from Nicolas MÃ©rouze (@nmerouze)</title>
      <description type="html">
        <![CDATA[<p>I like this topic but feel like your proposal is too much theory and not enough practical use. Will you show a real-world application using immutability in Ruby?</p>

<p>You explain that immutability is getting more attention because of concurrency and parallelism. Maybe you could explain why because some people may not understand the relation you made (I&#39;m thinking about beginners who can have a hard time understanding these concepts, especially if they began learning Ruby before any other language).</p>
