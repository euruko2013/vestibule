        <![CDATA[<p>It&#39;s a pity you withdrew this... I hope the comments didn&#39;t look offensive. As said on my previous one. it does sound interesting as a topic- it just wasn&#39;t really well developed :(</p>

        <![CDATA[<p>Hello there,</p>

<p>the topic is really interesting to me in general but I believe your proposal needs some expansion. What exactly are you going to talk about?</p>

<ul>
<li>Is it going to be a rails vs node talk?</li>
<li>Is it going to be how to use framework and language A for some parts and framework and language B for some other parts?</li>
</ul>

<p>Also keep in mind that not everyone in the audience is a web developer - I am :)</p>

        <![CDATA[<p>You really need to add some detail or something that describes what you will say in 30 minutes in the talk. You namedrop 3 subjects that each can have their own conference so a single line description really does not say much</p>
