      <title>Suggestion from Clemens Kofler (@clemens)</title>
      <description type="html">
        <![CDATA[<p>I have a couple of problems with this proposal:</p>

<p>1) IMO, Prawn basically hasn&#39;t moved much in the last couple of years (1.0.0.rc1 =&gt; rc2 after 1 1/2 years!). While you certainly don&#39;t need to add features to a library that is relatively mature (which Prawn certainly is), it shouldn&#39;t rot for months either.
2) The Prawn documentation is rock-solid. I don&#39;t see which benefits a talk would bring over just working through the documentation.
3) While I like Prawn for certain tasks (and still use it to this day), I have found that wkhtmltopdf (and its wrapper wicked<em>pdf) are way more relevant for real-world applications like generating PDF versions of views (e.g. invoices, product data sheets etc.) because HTML/CSS are just way easier to handle. Of course, this is highly subjective and wkhtmltopdf (and therefore wicked</em>pdf) certainly has its own set of specific problems – but in this case I&#39;d prefer practical use.</p>
