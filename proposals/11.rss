        <![CDATA[<p>Hi Filip, thanks for your suggestion. I&#39;d like to try to persuade you otherwise! I know that some of my ideas might be impractical or a hard sell, but I think that&#39;s what makes them provocative and interesting to discuss.</p>

<p>I think there are some architectural downsides to relying on autoload, but, on a more prosaic note, it poses problems for multi-threaded applications. <a href="http://blade.nagaokaut.ac.jp/cgi-bin/scat.rb/ruby/ruby-core/41149">Matz himself has said that autoload might be dropped in Ruby 3.0</a> for this reason.</p>

        <![CDATA[<p>I dont think that autoloading should be dropped.  I have php experience where autolading is used very much to provide IoC container, speed up (reduce loading of files that are not required)  etc. </p>
