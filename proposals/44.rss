        <![CDATA[<p>Actually the talk is similar to the delta cloud talk about the open source software cloudfoundry.
Both projects are somehow funded by the industry.</p>

        <![CDATA[<p>If I&#39;m not mistaken, cloudfoundry is an open source product backed up from commercial companies/partners. So I&#39;m not sure this is in &#39;violation&#39; or rules - unless of course it promotes the commercial part of it which is the actual PaaS hosting. So the proper question for is: Is this presentation going to be for <a href="http://www.cloudfoundry.org/">http://www.cloudfoundry.org/</a> or <a href="http://www.cloudfoundry.com/">http://www.cloudfoundry.com/</a>? </p>

        <![CDATA[<p>Hi</p>

<p>According to the &#39;Rules&#39; <a href="http://cfp.euruko2013.org/about">http://cfp.euruko2013.org/about</a> having a talk which just promotes a product is forbidden.</p>

<p>However, from what it looks like, you can give us insight as to how Ruby may be used to &quot;to operate, maintain and scale the platform&quot; as you say using Bosh.</p>

<p>So, if I was you, I&#39;d change the angle to focus on this latter aspect of your talk rather than an outright presentation of CloudFundry (which is otherwise very interesting for many, including myself:-)</p>
