        <![CDATA[<p>I love the topic and the description but I would really appreciate it if we could get some feedback from the proposal author regarding @John&#39;s question: &quot;Are these patterns Heroku-specific only&quot;?</p>

      <description type="html">
        <![CDATA[<p>@svs: Most likely. ;-)</p>

<p>I&#39;m gonna stick with what I wrote in reply to the other talk (which dropped the same company name): The topic and description alone would have been sufficient to get me interested.</p>

<p>So you got my vote (as did the other proposal), even though I don&#39;t want to see both of them.</p>

<p>I&#39;d still appreciate it, if you could remove the company name. I really liked the anonymous approach Euruko was going for. This feels a bit like a cheap shot.</p>
