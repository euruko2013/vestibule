      <title>Suggestion from John Pagonis (@)</title>
      <description type="html">
        <![CDATA[<p>&quot;how Clojure has changed the way we write Ruby code, approaches to concurrency and code structuring&quot; this by itself should make an interesting talk :-)
I don&#39;t know how other feels but I think this quoted sentence is more than enough to fill the presentation time with substantial points.</p>

<p>Perhaps we wouldn&#39;t want to see how to migrate away from Ruby(during a Ruby conf:-) , but rather about the learning we can bring into Ruby and the learning we can give to other languages.</p>
