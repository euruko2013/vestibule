                    <p><p>David Padilla is CEO at Crowd Interactive, a leader Ruby on Rails consultancy based in Mexico.</p>

<p>He&#39;s usually trying out all the new technologies that come out everyday, and, sometimes, just knowing how to use them is not enough, so, he spends a lot of his free time reading other people&#39;s code.</p>

<p>Through his career, he has been devoted to promoting the Ruby on Rails community in Mexico through rails.mx and the organization of the only Ruby conference in the area: Magma Conf.</p>

            Web applications with Ruby (not Rails)

        <div class="description"><p>These days, whenever you say that you&#39;re building a web application with Ruby, its almost implied that you will be using Rails to do so.</p>

<p>Well, what if you don&#39;t want to use Rails? Or Sinatra? Or any other Framework for that matter. What if you just want to roll your own code for routing, controllers, rendering and models?</p>

<p>Join me in this live coding experiment, I promise no slides and a lot of live coding action while we build an application from scratch using nothing but good old fashioned Ruby and a little Rack.</p>

                    <section class="body"><p>Thank you all for the suggestions.</p>

<p>This is more of a beginner level talk. While you probably never want to do this in production, I like to think that we must know our tools and a little of the philosophy that eventually became the frameworks themselves over time.</p>

<p>The talk is more about inciting to think on the solutions that are already solved by the frameworks and that we take for granted.</p>

<p>That is why I want to do live coding, not just about showing code, but also about giving it some thought and build things little by little which is probably how our ancestors built Rails, Sinatra, Padrino and others in their time.</p>

<p>I can probably replace the live coding with video to save it for the posterity. I&#39;m actually beginning to think its a better idea.</p>

                    <section class="body"><p>I agree with John that the &quot;why?&quot; aspect of your talk needs to be addressed: Sure, it&#39;s hell of interesting to do things yourself and not use any existing frameworks. But was are the practical aspects of this? There are so many Ruby web frameworks out there – some of them fully featured (like Rails), some of them small and nimble (like Sinatra) – that, in my mind, you&#39;d have to have a very good reason to skip frameworks altogether and write your whole stack from scratch.</p>

                    <section class="body"><p>The important bit which you need to address is &quot;Why?&#39;. why would we want to do what you suggest? So that people vote on your presentation based not on what can be done, but rather on what the learning will be.</p>

<p>I also suggst that you do promise to present using slides. Having a coding session only talk is difficult and leaves not collateral material for posterity. A deck of slides is good for people that want to re-review your talk. The committee will alos need to see that you are well prepared before the event should your talk is voted for.</p>
