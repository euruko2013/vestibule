        <![CDATA[<p>Netzke allowed me to develop a couple of important apps in matter of days.
I like almost every aspect of this framework. Looking forward to meet author.
And yes, agree with Ebin J, Netzke will benefit from better documentation. :)</p>

        <![CDATA[<p>If that&#39;s whom I think (the author of Netzke), I have seen him back in 2010 on Rubyandrails Amsterdam and was very impressed with it. The guy is a great speaker and what he showed us just blew my mind.
Looking forward to see him!</p>

        <![CDATA[<p>I&#39;ve used Netzke to develop pretty complex application for banking sector, and really enjoyed cleanliness of the design. It allowed me to finish project in much shorter time than I anticipated.</p>
