      <title>Suggestion from the proposer</title>
      <description type="html">
        <![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p>I not convinced (anymore I should say) that Model-View-Controller is the best answer to “How you build your application?”.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Exactly, worst case what actually I am facing is hearing programming languages, framework names, even worst versions. 
Mvc is a way to build an application, I am not currently in the position to comment (soon to come) but I can use it as an example.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I figure it&#39;s more important to actually manage the how, rather than the partitioning into the parts that MVC provides.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>MVC here is just by accident (&quot;Architecture the lost years&quot; by Robert Martin), but I will play its game to get my point out.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Thinking about how Use Cases, stories and &#39;guiding principles&#39; (like the single responsibility or open/closed principles) might be more helpful to come up with good ways to build an application.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is big room to talk about good ways and would love this conversation. I want to get developers out of the main &quot;following the tutorial&quot; mentality when they build applications by spoiling them.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That said: I may well be wrong. :-</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is no such thing as a silver bullet. :)</p>

<p>@Stephan, Thanks you for writing/reading the above.</p>

<p>I figure it&#39;s more important to actually manage the <em>how</em>, rather than the partitioning into the parts that MVC provides. 
Thinking about how Use Cases, stories and &#39;guiding principles&#39; (like the single responsibility or open/closed principles) might be more helpful to come up with good ways to build an application.</p>

        <![CDATA[<p>Feel free to include more information inside the proposal text if you want. I like the topic so, some more information inline would help everyone I guess!</p>
