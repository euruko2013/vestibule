      <title>Suggestion from John Pagonis (@)</title>
      <description type="html">
        <![CDATA[<p>Is this talk going to show-off Celluloid on CRuby/YARV vs JRuby or will it address other VMs as well?</p>

<p>There seem to be too much good stuff on your proposal which may be too for 30mins presentation + 15mins QA. Perhaps discussing about the GVL issue vs JRuby&#39;simplementation is unecessary if what you are trying to achieve is to present Celluloid and the actor-based way of programming in Ruby.</p>
