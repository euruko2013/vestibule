      <title>Suggestion from Paul Battley (@threedaymonk)</title>
      <description type="html">
        <![CDATA[<p>As someone who implemented a simple Ruby-to-JavaScript proof-of-concept transpiler many years ago, I&#39;m very interested in this talk, and especially in the details of how you implemented the Ruby object model.</p>

<p>I still don&#39;t think the title&#39;s quite right: <em>get back <em>at</em>*</em> means &quot;exact revenge upon&quot;. You probably want <em>get back <strong>to</strong></em>, in the sense of &quot;return to&quot;, yes?</p>

        <![CDATA[<p>This sounds really interesting! The details on the internals I&#39;d find particularly interesting to learn, as well as issues discovered while implementing it (cross-browser issues maybe?).</p>

      <description type="html">
        <![CDATA[<p>The talk seems very interesting, as I said. however to be fair to others and in order for everyone to know what they are voting for, I&#39;d like to see more details about the talk. Perhaps a bulleted skeleton would help?</p>

<p>btw the title needs a minor correction &quot;Opal, get back <em>at</em> doing Ruby....&quot; :-)</p>

        <![CDATA[<p>Totally agree with what John said. Even though it sounds interesting to see what you can achieve with Opal, some information regarding how it&#39;s implemented would be really nice!</p>

        <![CDATA[<p>Is this only about usage of Opal or does it also cover its internals as well?</p>

<p>I&#39;d suggest that you cover both intro/usage of Opal as well as its design. I also hope it is not just an intro tutorial with basic info which anyone could pick from the Opal site.</p>

<p>I for once i&#39;m interested in the subject btw :-)</p>
