      <description type="html">
        <![CDATA[<p>I didn&#39;t know that there was a top level Apache project written in Ruby. Really exciting! As for the proposal now, I would like a clarification: is this talk going to be a presentation of the functionality or how what it implemented in Ruby and Sinatra? The proposal description as it is looks more like a description of the project itself and not of the presentation.</p>
