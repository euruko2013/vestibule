        <![CDATA[<p>The aforementioned number of tests refers solely to UI tests running over rspec or cucumber tests for checking javascript functionalities. The number of tests written for models or testing APIs are not included. Main concept behing this presentation is the mentality of writting such tests (or when not to), and some do and dont&#39;s we got together over our experience. </p>

        <![CDATA[<p>Would be cool if author describe <strong>how he got to this situation?</strong></p>

<p>We had the same experience with monstrous large legacy project - a &quot;mega-rails&quot; one with 2500 tests that run over 25 minutes... We in team have done a series of brainstorming, and made a decision to split it to (now counting 8!) separate REST APIs. This brought success! Each API had own, clear and decoupled tests, and, even though once everything was built we have like 3000 tests in total, they run much faster, most of them are clear and they allow us to look for future challenges.</p>
