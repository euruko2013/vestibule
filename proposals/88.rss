        <![CDATA[<p>It&#39;s a cool piece of software, but (as a regular Euruko attendee &amp; occasional speaker) I have to agree with Javier: Two times is probably enough. (A lighting talk or live example would be nice though.)</p>

        <![CDATA[<p>I absolutely want to attend this presentation, because I was one of them afraid it were too difficult to build such an application. Many pluses and looking forward to it. I believe it will save me a lot of time.</p>
