      <title>Suggestion from the proposer</title>
      <description type="html">
        <![CDATA[<p>This talk would mostly be focused on rails applications, but some of the techniques that I will discuss will be applicable outside of rails.  </p>

<p>A couple of the specific concepts I am thinking about are: separate data access from the final UI with API&#39;s, and using object composition to simplify large classes (models).</p>

      <title>Suggestion from Nikos Dimitrakopoulos (@)</title>
      <description type="html">
        <![CDATA[<p>What you are going to say, are only applicable to Rails applications or are they generic enough for people outside the Rails world to use? I&#39;m asking because I believe a certain percentage of the audience won&#39;t be rails developers (I am :D). Is this presentation going to be useful for them?</p>
