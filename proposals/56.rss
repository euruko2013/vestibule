      <title>Suggestion from the proposer</title>
      <description type="html">
        <![CDATA[<p>The rationale behind this proposal is that I assume there will be quite some attendees who work on their own startups, have to advice on UX or are just interested in the human mind. Is it a Ruby talk? No. Is it interesting to web developers and humans in general? Definitely!</p>

<p>Disclaimer: I am a Rubyist, not a psychologist. I&#39;ve been interested in (online) influence and persuasion for a while though and have read pretty much all the standard works on the subject. I may not be an expert, but I do teach some useful tricks :-)</p>

        <![CDATA[<p>Hello there author! :)</p>

<p>Even though the topic is really interesting to me, I can&#39;t understand how it relates to Ruby. Would you care to expand a little bit the description addressing this?</p>
