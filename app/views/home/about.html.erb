    <h1>What is this?</h1>

    <p>
        This app is a tool to help us &mdash; the community &mdash; generate and prepare
        the actual presentations of <a href="<%= Settings.main_site %>"><%= Settings.event_name %></a>.
        It's strongly based on <a href="http://rubymanor.org/">Ruby Manor's</a> original
        <a href="http://vestibule.rubymanor.org/proposals">vestibule app</a>, and we really thank them for that!
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong><%= Settings.event_name %> would be a lesser conference without your talk proposals</strong>.
        We think that almost everyone has something interesting to talk about,
        so please think about that fun or unusual or difficult or surprising thing
        you&rsquo;ve done recently and submit a talk (or several!) so everyone can hear about it.

    <h1>The CfP process</h1>

    <section id="rationale">
        <h2>Rationale</h2>
        <p>
            The CfP was designed with the following goals in mind:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Encourage proposal submissions by everyone (irrespective of publicity, gender, race, domain etc).</li>
            <li>Encourage refinements on proposals.</li>
            <li>Make sure that the selection process is neutral and unbiased.</li>
            <li>Make sure that the most interesting proposals are actually selected by the community.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="process-overview">
        <h2>The process overview</h2>
        <p>
            The process is an amalgamation of
            <a href="http://vestibule.rubymanor.org/the-vestibule-process" target="_blank">Ruby Manor's ‘Vestibule’ process</a>,
            <a href="https://github.com/euruko2012/call-for-proposals" target="_blank">last year’s EuRuKo</a>
            and our own ideas and favourite picks from various conferences we have attended ourselves in the past.

            The main ideas are rather simple:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Make it safe and easy for everyone to submit their proposal.</li>
            <li>Gather, discuss and refine a lot of ideas in an anonymous (blind) way without prejudice.</li>
            <li>Make a shortlist of the best proposals using some “interestingness” criteria.</li>
            <li>Publicly vote for the presentations that you want to see.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Phase 1: Submission and discussion</h3>
        <p>
            The CfP platform opens for submissions and everyone can submit unlimited number of proposals.
            During this period everyone can interact with the proposals which means:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Discuss</li>
            <li>Promote/Demote</li>
            <li>Share on social media</li>
            <li>Refine</li>
            <li>Withdraw</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            During Phase 1 proposals show up <strong>without revealing the name of the submitter or any other
            “interestingness” information</strong>. This is in order to avoid any bias and to help people
            focus on the content of the proposal.
        </p>
        <p>
            We want to encourage <strong>everyone</strong> to participate in <%= Settings.event_name %>
            as fully as possible and one of the ways we can ensure that everyone is treated equally
            is by not revealing who is behind each proposal.
        </p>

        <h3>Interlude: Submissions freeze &amp; final call for shortlist selection</h3>
        <p>
            At a certain date (TBA) submissions close and everyone can interact with the proposals only
            for the purpose of making a final shortlist on which the final voting will take place.
            "Interacting" means:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Promote/Demote</li>
            <li>Share on social media</li>
            <li>Withdraw</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Phase 2: Final voting &amp; selection</h3>
        <p>
            A formal second round of voting then takes place on the proposals that made it into the shortlist.
            The main difference with Phase 1 is that now <strong>there is no commenting</strong>
            and that the proposals are <strong>de-anonymized</strong>
            (this is also true for proposals that didn’t make the cut).

        <p>
            You should take a look at <%= link_to "list of things people are hoping to get out of #{Settings.event_name}", motivation_path %>
            for some inspiration.

        <h3>How long should my talk be?</h3>

        <%= Settings.proposals_duration.html_safe %>
        <% end %>

        <h3>How anonymous does my proposal have to be?</h3>

        <p>
            Although the proposal system is completely anonymous during Phase 1 of the process,
            we can&rsquo;t prevent you from including identifying information either within the proposal itself
            or on the wider internet. Sometimes this is inevitable: if you want to give a talk about this
            great programming language called Ruby that you developed in 1993, it&rsquo;s not going to take
            too much detective work to reveal your identity.

            That&rsquo;s fine, and there&rsquo;s no need to go to ridiculous lengths to conceal your identity
            if it makes the proposal more difficult to write, but just respect the spirit of the process:
            as far as is sensible and practical, we would like for talks to be chosen because of what
            they&rsquo;re about, not because of who's presenting.
        </p>

        <h3>Do I have to go through with it if I propose something?</h3>

        <p>
            Of course not! No one is going to force you to give a talk just because you proposed it!
            You always have the option to withdraw your proposal if change your mind or discover you
            can&rsquo;t make it to the conference.
        </p>

        <p>
            That being said, after the final selection is completed (Phase 2), we <strong>will</strong>
            require commitment from your side after having confirmed with you that you are indeed interested
            in attending and presenting at EuRuKo 2013.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section id="faq-suggestions">
        <h2>Suggestions</h2>

        <h3>Why should I participate?</h3>

        <p>
            As mentioned before the goals of the process are, among others, to choose the best
            proposals and also to help them improve. This way, we can enjoy the most interesting
            talks during <%= Settings.event_name %>. To convince you to get engaged, we are planning
            to reserve tickets for <%= Settings.event_name %> for those who have contributed
            positively in the proposals suggestion and selection process.
        </p>

        <h3>What sort of suggestions should I make about a proposal?</h3>

        <p>
            Read the proposal in detail and provide feedback about how you think
            it could be clarified or improved. Ask questions about what it will involve.
            Be constructive and explain what needs to happen in order for the proposal
            to become something you&rsquo;re willing to vote for.
        </p>

        <p>
            Try to avoid simple &ldquo;+1&rdquo; or &ldquo;Yes, sounds good.&rdquo; style suggestions.

            Say <em>why</em> you&rsquo;re &ldquo;+1&rdquo;-ing the proposal -
            there&rsquo;s got to be a reason and it&rsquo;s possible that you&rsquo;ve assumed
            they&rsquo;ll cover something that they weren&rsquo;t planning to.
        </p>

        <h3>What do I do with suggestions on my proposals?</h3>

        <p>
            There are many ways to deal with suggestions.
            You <em>can</em> simply ignore them - but we think you&rsquo;ll write a better talk
            and get more out of the process if you actively engage with them.

            You can respond with your own comments (which will remain anonymous),
            you can tweak your proposal to accommodate them, or to explicitly rule them out.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section id="faq-selection">
        <h2>Selection</h2>

        <h3>How is the "shortlist" decided?</h3>

        <p>
            The shortlist will be decided based on “interestingness” factors some of which may be:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Number of views</li>
            <li>Number of comments</li>
            <li>Number of votes</li>
            <li>Mentions on social networks</li>
            <li>Number of refinements</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>How many proposals will make it into the shortlist?</h3>

        <p>There will be 30 slots for the shortlist.</p>

        <h3>How do talks get chosen from the shortlist?</h3>

        <p>
            Once the shortlist is finalized everyone will be able to select
            their favourite picks amongst the entries in the shortlist.
            Once the votes are in, the proposals with the most votes get picked,
            we inform the proposers that they have been successful,
            and we confirm their availability.
        </p>

        <h3>How many proposals will be selected?</h3>

        <p>
            10 proposals will be selected from the community (a.k.a. by voting)
            and 1 strictly by the <a href="http://euruko2013.org/#contributors">committee</a>.
        </p>

        <h3>What happens if my proposal makes it to <%= Settings.event_name %>?</h3>

        <p>
            We&rsquo;ll be in touch to confirm that you really are happy to give the talk.
            It&rsquo;s fine if you&rsquo;re not, there&rsquo;ll be no hard feelings.
            Assuming that you are we&rsquo;ll arrange the final details and announce it officially!
