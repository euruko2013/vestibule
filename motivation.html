<h2>Why do you care about EuRuKo 2013?</h2>
<p>We&rsquo;re interested in what <em>you</em> are hoping to get out of EuRuKo 2013, so that we - and that&rsquo;s everyone else, from speakers to other attendees - can help <em>you</em> achieve that.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a sampling:</p>

I&#39;m 27y old, working as a Senior Software Engineer at Red Hat in Brno, Czech republic. I do a lot of Ruby programming and I contribute to many Ruby projects and libraries.</p>

  <blockquote><cite><a href="users/275.html">Konstantin Tennhard</a>:</cite><p>I am a computer scientist who specializes in developing large scale internet applications. My main scientific interest is natural language processing. In general, I&#39;m passionate about software design, test driven development, all sorts of modern web-technology and of course Ruby.</p>

<p>I&#39;m curious to exchange and share ideas on how we as developers can leverage science to build smarter applications that provide greater user experience. In this sense, I&#39;d especially love to share my passion for natural language processing with others and discuss what we can gain from making the computer understand natural language.</p>

  <blockquote><cite><a href="users/26.html">Pablo Astigarraga</a>:</cite><p>Pablo Astigarraga (best known as pote) spends his time writing debatably passable code, doing software engineering at Citrusbyte and somehow tricking the world into thinking he knows what he is doing.</p>

<p>Passionate about open source, doing things right, having fun with cool people and using spaces instead of tabs, pote copes with a somewhat unhealthy relationship with mustaches and is always willing to discuss the evils of premature optimization over a beer.</p>

  <blockquote><cite><a href="users/309.html">Corey Woodcox</a>:</cite><p>Ruby and I are what some may call &quot;going steady.&quot; We do everything together. I&#39;ve spoken at the last 2 <a href="http://mtnwestrubyconf.com/">MountainWest RubyConf</a> conferences, and the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fxtr7UstV1g">last one</a> was awesome. Git is my secret lover. I love listening to good music, and I never go anywhere without some sort of Apple product on me.</p>

<p>I work for a Salt Lake City company called <a href="http://octanner.com/">OC Tanner</a>. We make awards for people who do great things.</p>

<p>I like to write, and I wish I had more time to do it. Skullcandy is great, and I like music loud.</p>

<p>I&#39;m a novice cinematographer. I love photography too, but video is where my passion is when it comes to light.</p>

<p>I&#39;m fluent in French, and I speak it to myself without realizing it. Oh, I talk to myself sometimes, too...</p>

It has been very interesting to be a part of this wonderful community and to learn along with it the best way of building large, complex real world applications. I do believe I have one or two learnings to contribute and I&#39;d love the opportunity to show you how I build Ruby applications and present them to the web! Do upvote my proposal on how to &quot;build your own web framework in half an hour&quot;. </p>

<p>I’m a passionate web application developer, Ruby enthusiast and (long|snow|wake) boarder. I love travelling, especially to warm countries, which is another reason that I’m exited about Euruko 2013. But most of all I’m looking forward to connecting with Ruby folks from all across Europe to share experiences, learn new stuff and have a good time.</p>

<p>I’m responsible for the web development of Codeship where we’re constantly trying to make our software development more sustainable, efficient and fun. We’ve elaborated a work flow that’s simple and lets us focus on what we really love: Coding Ruby.</p>

  <blockquote><cite><a href="users/191.html">Mike AbiEzzi</a>:</cite><p>As a consultant working with a new client every 3-6 months, I&#39;ve had my fair share of working on complex domains, and it can be ugly. I&#39;ve been actively practicing domain driven design to take the ugly out of what should be a beautiful expression of a domain. With past trials, failures, and successes, I hope to share the lessons I&#39;ve learned with one of the best open source communities that I enjoy so much, ruby and rails.</p>

<p>Aside from enjoying the art of expressing a domain in code, I mainly enjoy helping startups make those tough, strategic decisions on how and when to use technology to build their business, with the challenge of maintaining speed of delivery and quality.</p>

<p>Outside the context of staring at a computer screen, I retreat to nature, trail running, skiing, mountain biking, and pretty much anything else not computers.</p>

<p>EuRuKo is by far my favourite Ruby conference. It&#39;s refreshing to see rubyists from all over Europe get together and celebrate Matz&#39;s creation by talking about Ruby, sharing their knowledge and having a great time.  The array of speakers and the diversity of subjects never ceases to amaze me.</p>

When I&#39;m not at the keyboard, I enjoy spending time with my wife and two kids. I&#39;m also a fluent Spanish speaker and travel frequently to Spain to visit my wife&#39;s family.</p>

<p>Aside from learning some new things and seeing some great presentations, my real goal at EuRuKo is to meet people. I&#39;ve crossed paths with so many European Rubyists on Twitter and in other places - meeting some of them in person would be fantastic.</p>

<p>The Ruby community and its conferences are great because it lets me get in touch with the community that&#39;s nurtured and supported me for the years I&#39;ve been in the industry and gives me a great chance to give back by sharing the things I&#39;m most passionate about - programming, linguistics, learning and how you can be better at all of these. </p>
